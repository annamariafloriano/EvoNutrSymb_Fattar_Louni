Phylogenies contains the pipelines used for phylogenetic inferences.

SelComm.R contains the commands for selection of orthologs for FLE phylogeny inference
CLE_SelComm.R contains the commands for selection of orthologs for CLE phylogeny inference
GetNtClusters.py is a python script to retrieve the nucleotide sequences of the protein clusters given protein clusters and input files (ffn, before translation to proteins to be used as input for OrthoFinder)

changeHeaders.py, printMultLines.1.sh, printMultLines.2.sh, printMultLines.3.sh, renameFASTAheaders_byFilename.py are used in the same pipeline to prepare the files and commands for the different steps.
